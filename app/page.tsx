          <p className="text-md my-4">
            Iâ€™m currently pursuing my Masterâ€™s in Cyber Security after completing my B.Tech in Computer Science. Iâ€™m passionate about technology and have always loved exploring the endless possibilities it offers.
          </p>

            I hail from Bhubaneswar, Odisha, and Iâ€™ve had a lifelong fascination with puzzles, especially Rubikâ€™s cubes. A few years ago, I was deeply into speedcubing, and that obsession taught me the value of patience and problem-solving â€” qualities I now bring to my work in full stack web development. I focus primarily on building dynamic applications using JavaScript, but Iâ€™m always curious to explore new tech landscapes.

            My journey into programming began rather unexpectedly. Watching "The Social Network" in high school sparked a deep curiosity in me, and Iâ€™ve been coding ever since. I love diving into different tech domains and constantly learning, even if itâ€™s one small step at a time.

            When Iâ€™m not coding or writing articles to dump my thoughts (which you can find <Link href="/blog" className="underline">here</Link>), you might find me exploring new cybersecurity techniques or just tinkering around with new web frameworks. I'm excited about the future of tech, and Iâ€™m eager to be a part of its ever-evolving story.
